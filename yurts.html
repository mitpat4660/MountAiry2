<h2>The Yurts at Mount Airy Casino Resort</h2>
<dl>
<dt>The structure of our yurts</dt>
<dd>At our resort, we have luxury yurts for you. They are all permanent structures that are raised four feet off the ground. 
The wall of each yurt has
canvas in shape, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>
<dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
<dd>Each yurt that is at our resort is fully-furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.
The luxury camping experience also includes electricity and a sink with hot and
cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
<dt>What should I bring?</dt>
<dd>Yourself, and a mind that is prepared to enjoy. Also, bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! You can also consider coming with a pack comfortable
walking shoes and cloths that you can wear for the constantly changing weather.</dd>
